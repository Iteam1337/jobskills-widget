# Jobskills widget

A POC for a jobskills widget that shows potential candidates from the [Jobskills](jobskills.se) API based on metadata from the site the widget is placed.

### How it works

The widget works by: 
- Reading metadata from the site where it's placed ( currently just taking document.title )
- Sending that value to [Ontologi /text-to-structure](http://ontologi.arbetsformedlingen.se/ontology/v1/?url=swagger.json#!/Ontology/analyzeText)
- Fetching candidates from a mocked jobskills api search endpoint
- Showing the candidates by location with a packaged Vue component embeddable to any site

### Whats next?

This is only a POC to show what could be possible with an open Jobskills API, with that in place this widget could easily be modified to use the real enpoint. Then anyone could easily embed this widget on their site or use this as an example to implement their own solutions.

# Using the widget

To use the widget include the following code to your html

```
<div id="jobskills-widget"></div>
<script src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/seband/widget.js"></script>
